    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Crispy Tofu Sisig is a dish composed of deep fried tofu cubes, chopped
      chili peppers, and onion. It is healthier alternative to traditional pork
      sisig because it does not use any meat and greasy ingredients. Aside from
      being healthy, this crispy tofu sisig recipe is also vegan. This means
      that it does not contain any animal by-product.

    <p>
      Making your own crispy tofu sisig at home is fairly easy. First, makes
      sure that you have all the ingredients on hand. You will specifically need
      need extra firm tofu; using other types of tofu wonâ€™t give you the same
      result. Use the amount of chili peppers according to your tolerance level.
      Add more chili if you want it to be extra hot and spicy, or use lesser if
      you want it to be milder.
